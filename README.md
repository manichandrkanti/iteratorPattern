# Iterator Pattern implemented on Flat Breads Example
Iterate means to perform a task repeatedly. <br />
The iterator allows a customer to go over the elements of a Bread collection without knowing how the collection is implemented.<br />
A collection can be a list, array, arraylist, hashmap or any other fancy datastructure. A collection signifies a bunch of objects.<br />
An iterator is formally defined as a pattern that allows traversing the elements a Bread collection sequentially without exposing the underlying implementation like name or type.<br />
